        <h2>What Is a Pallet Jack?</h2>
        <p>A pallet jack is a common warehouse tool used for lifting and moving palletized goods.</p>
        <p>It has two long forks that slide under a pallet and a hydraulic pump that helps lift the load a few inches off the ground.</p>
        <p>Workers can then push or pull the pallet to a new location.</p>
        <p>Pallet jacks are easy to operate, require no electricity, and are essential for everyday material handling in stores, factories, and distribution centers.</p>
